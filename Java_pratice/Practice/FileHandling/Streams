STREAMS:
    In Java, “stream” refers to a continuous flow of data.
    Streams are used for input (reading data) and output (writing data).

    Think of a stream like a pipe through which data moves from one place to another.

    There are two types of streams :
        Byte Stream
        Character Streams

Byte Streams:
    Used for reading and writing the raw binary data(8 -bits)
    Two types :
        -> IntputStream
            The inputStreams is used to read the data.
            Important subclasses:
                FileInputStream → read files
                ByteArrayInputStream → read from byte array
                BufferedInputStream → fast reading
                ObjectInputStream → read objects (serialization)
                FilterInputStream
                PipedInputStream
                DataInputStream → read primitives (int, float, etc.)

        -> OutputStream
            The outputStream is used to write the data
            Important subclasses:
                FileOutputStream → write to file
                ByteArrayOutputStream → write to byte array
                BufferedOutputStream → faster writing
                ObjectOutputStream → write objects
                FilterOutputStream
                PipedOutputStream
                DataOutputStream → write primitives

Character Stream:
    Used for reading and writing the text.
    There are two types:
      -> Reader (for reading characters):
            Important subclasses:
                FileReader → read text file
                BufferedReader → read lines efficiently
                InputStreamReader → converts bytes to chars (BRIDGE CLASS)
                CharArrayReader
                StringReader
                FilterReader
                PipedReader
                PushbackReader

        -> Writer (for writing characters) :
            Important subclasses:
                FileWriter → write to text file
                BufferedWriter → fast writing
                OutputStreamWriter → converts chars to bytes (BRIDGE CLASS)
                CharArrayWriter
                StringWriter
                FilterWriter
                PipedWriter
                PrintWriter (very popular)
