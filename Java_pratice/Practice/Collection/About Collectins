In java there are several collections are used to optimize the program.
Likewise, with the help of collections the user can new type of collections.

The iteratable interface:
    The iteratable interface has the collections interface.
    Because all the collections in the in the collection interface will implement the iteratable, this will help the user to interate over the objects such as list.
    The iteratable interface specifies an iterator to access the elements sequentially of an iterable objects.


List Interface:
    The list elements are stored on an order and the list can contain the duplicates.
    List methods:
        E get(int index)
        E set(int index, E element)
        void add(int index, E element)
        boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c)
        E remove(int index)

    List implementaions:
        ArrayList
        LinkedList
        Vector

    ArrayList:
        It s used we don't know the size of the array.
    Vector:
        It's similar to the ArrayList but, the vector is thread safe.

        ArrayList         |        LinkedList:
    Direct access of the  |   There is no direct acess
    element.              |


    ListIterator:
        interface ListIterator<E> extends Iterator<E>  {
            boolean hasNext();
            boolean hasPrevious();
            E next(); // Element after the cursor
            E previous(); // Element before the cursor

            List provides two methods
                ListIterator<E> listIterator()
                ListIterator<E> listIterator(int index)
